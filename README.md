😈 Only-NONE Client Hub | Gate to the Underworld

"We are not building a boring store. We are building a Gate to the Underworld."

💀 Overview

Only-NONE is a centralized, aesthetically immersive repository designed specifically for the Minecraft Bedrock (PE) anarchy community (2b2tPE, NetEase, etc.).

Unlike standard "material design" stores, this project utilizes a "Glitchy Altar" visual identity—prioritizing dark mode, gothic typography, and a "Blood & Concrete" palette to match the aggressive nature of anarchy servers.

⚡ Key Features

The Armory: Filterable list of clients (Utility, CPvP, Anarchy).

The Shrine: Detailed breakdown for each client with direct download links.

The Meta: A dynamic leaderboard tracking the current SPvP and CPvP meta (powered by SQL joins).

The Graveyard: Archived/Patched clients for educational purposes (Necromancy mode).

The Injector: Guide on using JiaYi Launcher and version overriding.

Real-Time Whispers: Live comment section using Supabase Realtime.

Direct Downloads: Zero ads, zero redirects. Just raw .dll and .apk files.

🛠️ The Tech Stack (No-Build Architecture)

We kept it raw and fast. No npm install. No webpack. Just pure performance running in the browser.

Frontend: React 18 (via CDN) + Babel (In-browser compilation).

Styling: Tailwind CSS (via CDN) with custom config for the "Blood & Concrete" theme.

Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for storing client data, rankings, and comments.

Hosting: GitHub Pages (Static hosting).

File Storage: GitHub Repository (Relative path linking).

🚀 Setup Guide (How to run this beast)

1. The Files

The folder structure must look like this for the "Direct Download" logic to work:

/ (root)
├── index.html          <-- The Main Brain
├── README.md           <-- You are reading this
└── artifacts/          <-- YOUR HACK FILES GO HERE
    ├── meteor.dll
    ├── prax.apk
    └── configs/
        ├── meteor.txt
        └── prax_god.txt


2. The Database (Supabase)

Create a new project on Supabase.

Go to the SQL Editor and run the following schema to create the tables:

-- Create Clients Table
create table clients (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  name text not null,
  author text,
  version text,
  type text, -- 'Utility', 'CPvP', 'Anarchy'
  os text, -- 'Windows', 'Android', 'iOS'
  status text, -- 'Free', 'Paid', 'Private', 'Archive'
  description text,
  features text[], -- Array e.g. ['Fly', 'Killaura']
  download_url text, -- Use relative path: './artifacts/file.dll'
  config_url text,   -- Use relative path: './artifacts/configs/file.txt'
  verified boolean default false,
  death_date text,
  death_note text
);

-- Create Rankings Table
create table meta_rankings (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  client_id bigint references clients(id),
  category text, -- 'CPVP' or 'SPVP'
  rank int,
  note text
);

-- Create Ratings & Comments Tables (Standard columns)
-- [Refer to full schema in project docs]


IMPORTANT: Go to Authentication > Policies and enable RLS (Row Level Security). Add a policy to allow Public (Anon) users to Select (Read) data. If you don't do this, the website will say "NO CLIENTS FOUND".

3. Connection

Open index.html and replace the keys at the top of the script:

const SUPABASE_URL = "YOUR_SUPABASE_URL"; 
const SUPABASE_KEY = "YOUR_ANON_KEY";


🏴‍☠️ Deployment

Push this repo to GitHub.

Go to Settings > Pages.

Set source to Deploy from Branch (main).

Wait 1 minute.

Your Gate to the Underworld is live.
